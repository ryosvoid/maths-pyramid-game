# Pyramid of Equations

A brainy yet beautiful game that tests your memory, logic, and math skills.

## How to Play

1. **Memorize Phase (10 seconds)**:
   - Study the pyramid of hexagonal tiles (A to J)
   - Each tile shows a number or operation (e.g., +5, ×2, -3)
   - Remember the target number displayed

2. **Solve Phase**:
   - Tiles flip to hide their content, showing only labels A-J
   - Click on 2-4 tiles in sequence to form an equation
   - If your equation equals the target → score +1
   - If not, tiles flip back and you try again

3. **Game Progression**:
   - Play continues for 5 rounds
   - Try to get the highest score possible!
